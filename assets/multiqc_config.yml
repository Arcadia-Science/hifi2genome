  This report has been generated by the <a href="https://github.com/Arcadia-Science/hifi2genome" target="_blank">Arcadia-Science/hifi2genome</a> analysis pipeline. The purpose of this pipeline is to assemble PacBio Hifi reads and produce QC stats about the assembly. This pipeline performs assembly with Flye, assembly statistics with QUAST lineage specific QC statistics with BUSCO, mapping of reads back to the assembly with minimap2 and subsequent mapping statistics with samtools.
